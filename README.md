- Spoke with Rokshana last week to find out if there was a syllabus developed for the course when it was proposed; she said no, but said that since the course was included in the approved curriculum she would not need to obtain approval from NYSED.
- Started researching sources for content, will first build an outline of topics; in progress.
- Found a potential textbook, need to purchase and review: http://www.aeeprograms.com/store/detail.cfm?id=1188&category_id=6; in progress.
